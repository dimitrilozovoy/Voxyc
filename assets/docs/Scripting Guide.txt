Voxyc Scripting Guide
-----------------------------------------

Intro

There are two main scripts in every project,
load.lua and tick.lua. The load script,
load.lua, runs once when you launch the game.
The tick script, tick.lua, runs on every frame,
repeatedly.

In load.lua, you create the objects. In tick.lua,
you manipulate and animate the objects
you created, frame by frame.
