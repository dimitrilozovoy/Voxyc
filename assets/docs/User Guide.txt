Intro

Voxyc editor is the app in which you create
your game's world by adding objects
(shapes, models and sprites). You can also
test-run your game within the editor by running
it's load script (see scripting guide).

A project may contain several scenes
(saved and loaded as .sc files from the
file menu). A scene is a collection of objects
and shapes, positioned in 3D space, ready
to be animated by scripts.

Each level / chapter / major screen in your
game will be a different scene, and possibly
a different set of scripts.
